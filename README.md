# NMCLIB04v64
Implementation of NMCLIB04.dll for 64 bit. Build with Visual Studio 2019.

I am forced to create this since the library given in [here](https://www.saelig.com/supplier/saelig-kerr/web/software.html) was made in 32 bit system.
On top of that, it was built using Borland C++ Compiler.

I hope this could help someone out there who are looking to use PIC SERVO SC Controller.
